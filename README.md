# PMD - Dungeon Generator
## Summary

A Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Map Generator based on the Binary Space Partitioning and Random Walk algorithms.

## Development

This game was made with [Unity](https://unity.com/fr).\
It was made using the logic presented in this video : [Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon - deconstructing the dungeon generation algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fudOO713qYo&list=PL4wvE9SgBKleqxDYrHov5nQC99nBysO8N).
